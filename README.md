# 0KnowledgeSim

Web-based simulation of the 2-prover and 2-verifier zero-knowledge protocol.

## Getting Started

A live version of the simulation can be viewed at the following link: [0KnowledgeSim](https://lucagdangelo.github.io./0KnowledgeSim)

To get a better understanding of the protocol as the simulation runs,  detailed logs of the protocol are displayed to the console under the Developer Tools of the browser.
